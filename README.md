Friend Finder

Technology Used:
a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- based off the dating app concept. This full-stack site will take in  user's surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I used Express to handle routing. And deployed to Heroku.
